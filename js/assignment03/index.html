    <h1> Noah Boyle's Assignment #3: Open Ended Game "Red Light, Green Light"</h1>
    <h3> In this game, The Doll from Netflix series "Squid Game" has collaborated with evil bears to kill players in her Red Light, Green Light game! The player needs to cross the red line in order to win. Watch out for the moving bears as they will knock you out and make you lose progress. If you move at all when The Doll is facing you in her Red Light phase, it is Game Over for you. Your score depends on how quickly you reach the finish line, so be quick while exercising caution!</h3>
