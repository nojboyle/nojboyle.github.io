		<h1>Your one stop place for all of your seasonal escapes!</h1>
		<h2>Objectives:</h2>
		<ul>
			<h3>Explore the world and collect coins!</h3>
			<h3>Autumn: Collect 10 coins hidden in the world to shift seasons over to Winter!</h3>
			<h3>Winter: Coins will fall from the sky like snow, fading in and out of view. Collect 15 of them to shift seasons over to Spring!</h3>
			<h3>Spring: Coins will move on the breeze like pollen in the wind. Catch and collect 10 of them to shift seasons over to Summer!</h3>
			<h3>Summer: Coins will move around like waves on water; nigh uncatchable and stopping for nothing. Collect 20 of them and you will win the game!</h3>
